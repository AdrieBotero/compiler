Today August 25, 2015 started working on my compilers project. I went over the notes that the teacher had as write in class.
Redraw some of the machine for understanding purposes. I also ready page 106 and look at some example code and diagrams.
I wrote down an algorithms for the ID machine.

Today August 27, 2015 I looked at some video on youtube about compilers. I also did my reserve word file. I added the words
from the grammar paper the teacher gave us into the file. I also store lexer error in a dictionary for user later in my
program.

Today August 31, 2015 started coding Relop machine, but I first did an algorithm on paper to have a clear idea what i am
coding. relop machine seem to be working fine.

Sept 01, 2015 I came to school really early to work on my compiler. Add more testing condition to the relop machine.

Sept 03, 2015. Today I worked on my REALLONG machine and got it done for the most part. I still need to add checking error.
and debug it. I also did an algorithm on paper with a state diagram. I also did a machines of machines method as a check
for character and to send the data to the corresponding machine.

Sept 06, 2015 Today I had to redo my ID_machine because it was not working properly. I also tight things up in my reallong
machine. I spend some time testing. I still need to test it by reading the file which ill be working on next.

Sept 07, 2015 today I setup git for this project. I realized I am constantly changing stuff and i would like to be able
to look at my history of changes. and thats all i did today.
