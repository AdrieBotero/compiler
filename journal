Today August 25, 2015 started working on my compilers project. I went over the notes that the teacher had as write in class.
Redraw some of the machine for understanding purposes. I also ready page 106 and look at some example code and diagrams.
I wrote down an algorithms for the ID machine.

Today August 27, 2015 I looked at some video on youtube about compilers. I also did my reserve word file. I added the words
from the grammar paper the teacher gave us into the file. I also store lexer error in a dictionary for user later in my
program.

Today August 31, 2015 started coding Relop machine, but I first did an algorithm on paper to have a clear idea what i am
coding. relop machine seem to be working fine.

Sept 01, 2015 I came to school really early to work on my compiler. Add more testing condition to the relop machine.

Sept 03, 2015. Today I worked on my REALLONG machine and got it done for the most part. I still need to add checking error.
and debug it. I also did an algorithm on paper with a state diagram. I also did a machines of machines method as a check
for character and to send the data to the corresponding machine.

Sept 06, 2015 Today I had to redo my ID_machine because it was not working properly. I also tight things up in my reallong
machine. I spend some time testing. I still need to test it by reading the file which ill be working on next.

Sept 07, 2015 Today I setup git for this project. I realized I am constantly changing stuff and i would like to be able
to look at my history of changes. and thats all i did today.

Sept 08, 2015  Today I am focusing on the INT machine. the first thing i did was to draw the state diagram so i can
understand and see what is happening. I then wrote an algorithm with the step that are going to take to execute the
INT Machine. For the most the project is coming a long. I believe int machine is done. I will start my REAL Machine
today as well and i will approach it the same way i did my int machine. That is draw state diagram and then write the
algorithm form it.

Sept 12, 2015, reworked on REAL AND LONG MACHINES. added new error messages to list and added more logic to machines of
machines. I still need to fix machines of machines because is still kind of buggy.

Sept 13 2015, Today I am going to be working on the token file and fix my machines of machines. I'll be also working on
reading the character from the file and test it.

Sept 15 2015 Today I am working on the output files. first ill work on the Listing File then ill work on the Token file.
I was finally able to get the token table going. It seems to be working but I realized I need to fix the INT Machine.

I was also able to get the Int Machine to recognize when and INT has a trailing of zeros. I still need to work on the
reserve words and check for them.
In the evening I decided to start the reserve word checking. and I seem to be able to accomplished it. current table

Sept 17, 2015 started to think about the listing file. Alright the identifier errors kind of work under the listing file
I still need to figure out why it is print my errors twice.

Sept 19, 2015 Today I worked on the List file and it seem to be working now. this is what it looks like now

I have to start working on the token file some more. I added code to the token file for the Token but i am not quite
sure what i need to for the attribute column. I will work on that tomorrow.

Sept. 22 2015, Today I am just fixing little bugs and make things more neat and try to finish with the token file.
Token file seem to be looking better now.

Sept 26 2015, so today I am working on getting the memory address of the ids and put them in the token file.

October 2 2015 Built addop and mulop machines. and wrote on journal.

October 4 2015 finished with my addop and mulop machines. i still need to work on my catch all machines.

october 6 2015 add addop and  mulop to my machines of machines and test them
here how the table looks now

I still need to fix my fix the relops being added to the dictionary

October 11, 2015 Today ill be working go on the relop machines make it more functional and that is put all relops
in a table and get their index.

October 16, 2015 finished fixing project 1. started massaging grammar.

October 17, 2015 created a word document and started massaging grammar did phase one remove all epsilon variable,
clean things up.. started on phase 2.

October 19 2015, created new document for phase 2 in massaging grammar. simulate nullable variable for grammar

October 22, 2015 remove left recursion on grammar.

October 23 2015 perform left recursion on grammar. started on parse table but not sure how to do it yet.

October 29 2015 created a excel sheet to do parse table for grammar. almost done with parse table.

November 11 2015 finish parse table, created a file call parse.py and started writing all the non-terminals as methods
and writing all the methods. Still not done.

November 23 2015 still coding all the terminal functions.
November 24 2015 finished all my terminal functions.
November 28 2015 started coding the match function
December 02 2015 trying to finish project 2 completely.
